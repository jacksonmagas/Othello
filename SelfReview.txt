Self Review:

One thing that I wish we had done differently in our design was doing a better job of separation of
responsibilities. For example the highlighted cell is stored in the model instead of the view, even
though the model does not need to interact with the highlighted cell directly. Also, the
KeyboardListener and MouseListener were originally internal classes in the controller, meaning that
the controller had to do some calculations with graphical points instead of only handling logical
concepts. The MouseListener was refactored into the view, and only communicated with the controller
through Moves, which greatly simplified reasoning about control flow and reduced coupling, however
we ran out of time to do the same with the KeyboardListener.

That said, using Move throughout the project to communicate between view, controller, strategy, and
model made it easier to reason about.

The process of adapting the provider code went smoothly, partially because they had several concepts
that were nearly identical to our implementation, such as enums representing the same things which
simply needed us to make lookup tables to convert between.

Most of our code didn't need to be changed, we simply made adaptor classes which allowed their
strategies to use our model through their model interface, and adaptor classes which allowed our
controller to use their view and strategies through our interfaces.

There we did add a few things such as the getWinner method to the ReadonlyReversiModel interface
because their interface required it, and it seemed like a useful feature.

The feature which took the most work to get working was properly restarting the game both during and
after a game had been finished. This was because the model and controller had to be able to receive
a restart game move from the AWT EventListener thread at any time and properly reset the state of
the model, the control flow of the model, the views, and ensure that no player was waiting for a move.
This was difficult to debug because the program could get stuck in an infinite loop where the event
listener thread started executing core game logic, or the core game loop could finish silently with
the view still responding normally but failing to restart the game.

What was your experience like with your providers?
- We received the complete Provider code late after few email discussions back and forth to get all
the applicable files and as a result had a shorter amount of time to integrate it with our Reversi
Game. Provider Team was helpful in terms of providing the code and being willing to answer any
questions that came up. Overall, we had a good experience with our providers.
