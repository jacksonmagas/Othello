Self Review:

What do you wish you had done differently in your design/implementation? Did you learn any lessons
from the code given to you, or the updates you had to make for your customers?
-
What was your experience like with your providers?
- We received the complete Provider code late after few email discussions back and forth to get all
the applicable files and as a result had a shorter amount of time to integrate it with our Reversi
Game. Provider Team was helpful in terms of providing the code and being willing to answer any
questions that came up. Overall, we had a good experience with our providers.
