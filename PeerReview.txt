# Provider Code Review

Design Critique:
The model should have ideally provided functionalities to restart the game. It would also be
helpful if the next step instructions were displayed to opposing player, so they would know the
appropriate next actions in the game. Also extended key support would have been a helpful ability
to have that would have been implemented through KeyListener. When the mouse moves over cells in
the UI of the game, it should have captured highlighted cells as the mouse moves(up, down, left,
right), so the user could see where a potential move would take place before committing the move.

Implementation Critique:
The model was lacking some functionalities that would have been nice to have such as pass turn,
and restart game. The colorful gameplay made the Reversi game more interactive and easy
to play/use. Overall, implementation was well done, and we encountered no major issues working with
the provided code.

Documentation Critique:
Noticed no major documentation issues in provider code. Readme was adequate in understanding
provider implementation of the Reversi game. Comments for interface and method explanations were
very descriptive and made code easy to work with and understand. Examples would have been helpful
when documenting difference between Model vs View features.

Design/Code Limitations:
The following functionalities were missing from provider code: missing Pass-Turn actions in UI and
doesn't have a restart option in UI. While pass-turn action in UI was a necessary actions missing
from the game, the restart option in UI is purely optional and just would have been nice to have.
Keyboard support could've been helpful to implement and should've been done through KeyListener.
