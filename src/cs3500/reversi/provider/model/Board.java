/**
 * <p>This class represents the Board of our Reversi game. The Board consists of a HashMap that
 * stores the Hex as the Key and the PlayerDisc as the Value. The Board also has a radius that
 * determines the size of the Board. The PlayerDiscs are initialized to EMPTY.</p>
 *
 * <p>The radius of this Board determines the size of the Board. Radius is measured using the
 * distance between the center points of each individual Hex. For instance, for a Board to
 * have a radius of 1 would mean that there is only one more outer layer of Hexagons surrounding
 * the center. This means that our representation of the radius uses a 1-based index rather than
 * a 0-based index.</p>
 *
 * <p>The first or (0,0) coordinate on our board is the center of our board, since we are using
 * axial coordinates. From there, the following "rings" on the board are initialized in a
 * counter-clockwise direction.</p>
 *
 * <p>All fields of this Board are private and final to ensure that unwanted mutation does not
 * occur.</p>
 *
 * <p>The Board follows the invariant that the radius is always a non-zero positive integer.</p>
